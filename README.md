### Goals
- Create full featured calendar API with simple interface
- Have full monthly calenadar of feasts and Saints
- have full paschal cycle calendar
- have fasting calendar
- accomodate both Old and New Calendars

### Ideas
- use flat files as backend instead of database
- **maybe** use TDD approach
- read only API due to the unchanging nature of the data
- utilize OOP for modularity of the codebase
- utilize FP concepts to minimize shared state when reasonable

### TODO
- [ ] clean up calendar data
- [ ] separate out Paschal cycle from menia
- [ ] make proper formula for Old Calendar Calculation
